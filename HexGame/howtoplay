A - "Adding Hexagons" mode
P - "Painting Hexagons" mode
S - "Adding Soldiers" mode
M - "Moving Soldiers" mode

You can create a couple of hexagons with A mode, and then paint them to different colors with P mode, and then add them some soldiers with S to use in combat
And make them move with M mode to let them fight. You can use left click to make actions as like selecting one of your hexagon and then select a target hexagon to attack.
This code needs to be recoded because of duplications and bugs, so don't wait for a clean code.
